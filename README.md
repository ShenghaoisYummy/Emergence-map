   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Apply Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
5. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
6. **Access the Application**:Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Usage

### Step 1: Upload Crop Images
- Navigate to the crop gap detection page on the platform.
- Select and upload images of your field or crops for analysis.

### Step 2: View Analysis Results
- The system processes the uploaded images using computer vision (OpenCV) to detect planting gaps.
- The results are displayed visually using interactive charts created with Matplotlib.

### Step 3: Access Replanting Recommendations
- Based on the analysis, receive specific suggestions and insights for replanting to address detected gaps.
- Use this information to make data-driven decisions for optimizing your crop yield.
